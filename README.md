# Zero To Hero

As an exercise I wanted to learn how PHP works and try out some modern tools
with it as well (HTMX & Tailwind). I missed the PHP boon of the 2000's and I
think it's a cool technology so I figured I would check it out. I called this
repo Zero To Hero because I think that this stack would probably get you from
"I learned how to code in college" to "I'm making a product" in the least
amount of time. There is no client side javascript thanks to HTMX and there is
no custom css thanks to tailwind. All anyone would need to learn is PHP and
HTML as far as languages go.

## Stack Rundown

- Server Side: PHP
- Client Side: HTMX
- Styling: Tailwind
- Database: MySQL
- Server: Nginx

## TODOS 
- [ ] Make mysql in docker work
